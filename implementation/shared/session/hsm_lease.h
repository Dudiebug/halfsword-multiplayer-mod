// Dropped weapons and loose props in owner sync (protocol rev 9): FREE/TOUCH/HOLD leases, host-arbitrated.
// A prop starts FREE (the host simulates and streams it, as host sync did before rev 26). Touching it
// grants a TOUCH lease; holding it (a hand's grab) grants a HOLD lease; HOLD beats TOUCH, and between two requests
// at the same level the first one standing keeps it (ties lose). The lessee streams BodyState itself; everyone
// else drives the prop toward that stream (BodyStateView: only the granted streamer's states apply). A lease
// lapses kLeaseLapseMs after the last report -- a Request renewing the touch/hold, sent every kClaimRenewMs while
// it lasts (LeaseClaim). A BodyState never renews: the lessee streams every tick for as long as it is the lessee,
// so a lessee that stopped renewing (crashed hand logic, lost link) must still lose the prop. The prop then reverts
// to FREE; leaving the session releases every lease a slot held. Weapons actively held/equipped are carried by
// Pose instead (protocol/hsm_owner.h) and never enter this table -- only loose/dropped weapons and level props do.
//
// The claim lifecycle (touch or hold -> request; let go -> keep a touch while the throw/push is still moving ->
// release after kRestReleaseMs at rest), the rest threshold and the stream of bodies nobody leases (as fast as a leased one while moving) follow
// Cyrex0/HalfSword-MP's HSMPWorld (docs/development/subsystems/world-replication.md), Copyright (c) 2026 Cyrex0 and

//
// Identity: a 64-bit propId every machine agrees on.
//   - A loose weapon: MakeWeaponPropId(lastOwnerEntity, lowByte), bit 63 clear. Owner sync (gameplay/prop_sync.cpp)
//     fills the low byte with MakeDropPropId's (seq << 1) | hand and bits 16-47 with a drop epoch, minted once by the
//     dropping fighter's machine: SheathSlot is a sheath type in this game, not unique per fighter (see "dropped
//     weapons" below). Bits 48-62 of a weapon id are always clear.
//   - A level prop: MakeLevelPropId(index) -- its index in the host's census (session/hsm_prop_census.h), which
//     every other machine matches to its own actor by class and place. Not a name: the level manager destroys the
//     actors tagged 'Random Delete' on a per-machine coin flip and re-spawns the ones tagged 'Respawn' under new
//     names (BP_LevelManager), so the two machines' names differ. Bit 63 set (kPropLevelBit), so the two id spaces
//     can never collide; bits 16-62 clear (IsCanonicalLevelPropId).
//   - A spawned object (rev 26, session/hsm_object.h): anything that appears mid-match. Bit 62 set, bit 63 clear, bits
//     56-61 the spawning slot, bits 32-55 clear, low 32 bits a per-slot sequence (MakeSpawnedId). The three kinds are
//     told apart by bits 63 and 62 alone, so they never collide (ValidPropId).
//   propId 0 is reserved ("no identity yet", e.g. a weapon nobody has ever held) and every decoder rejects it.
//   Since rev 26 an id names an OBJECT; its simulating bodies are numbered per object (hsm_object.h) and BodyState
//   carries {objId, body}. A lease still covers the whole object.
