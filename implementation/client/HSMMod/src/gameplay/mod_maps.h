// Modded maps (HSMMod 0.8.0-pre2): finds the custom maps installed as .pak files under Content/Paks (and ~mods and any
// subfolder) and the paks they come from, for the host's map picker and for a joining client's check against the host's
// pak. Nothing is loaded, sent or downloaded here. Pure rules (stock filter, catalogue, compatibility): shared
// session/hsm_modmaps.h.
//
// Two sources, merged:
//   files     a worker thread lists the *.pak files (stock ones skipped), hashes each one with SHA-256 (cached by path +
//             size + mtime in HSMMod-modpaks.cache next to HSMMod.log) and reads its own index to learn which maps it holds
//   registry  the game thread asks the engine's asset registry (UAssetRegistry::GetAssetsByClass for /Script/Engine.World)
//             which maps it knows; a map the pak index did not name is listed without a pak
// Game thread only, except the worker, which touches only its own state and the mutex-guarded results.
