// Phase 4 severs and stuck blades in owner sync (combat/hsm_sever.h). Game thread only.
//
// A sever starts natively where the blade is: Constraint_Weapon_Stuck_BP::Call_Dismember runs the struck Willie's
// "Dismember Function Initiate" and, 0.1 s later, "Dismember Function Delayed". When that Willie is a stand-in hit by a
// fighter simulated here, a script-VM pre-hook captures the call as a SeverClaim and blocks it (the stand-in must not
// lose a limb its owner keeps). The victim's owner rebuilds the call on its own fighter, with fresh vertex-paint boxes
// placed on its own bone, and runs the game's own two functions, so the limb comes off there exactly as in a solo fight.
// Everyone else keeps the claim until the owner's vitals report the part severed, then runs the same two functions on
// their stand-in (dismemberment briefly allowed for that one call). Without a claim the gore fallback shows it.
// A sever a fighter simulated here takes natively (its own blade, another fighter simulated here such as a bot on the
// host, a trap) runs as the game runs it; a post-hook on its accepted Initiate sends the same arguments as a SeverNotice
// (attacker == victim, combat/hsm_sever.h), which everyone else keeps like a claim. The notice does not name the striker:
// unless the fighter cut itself, a stand-in's Delayed gets the fresh VP box as its weapon, so the limb does not ignore
// the striker's blade there.
//
// A blade stuck in a stand-in (the weapon's "Stuck Constraints Array") is reported on/off; the victim's owner holds the
// attacker's stand-in weapon to its own bone with a PhysicsConstraintComponent while it is stuck, as the game's own
// Constraint_Weapon_Stuck_BP joins blade and body: angular motion locked, linear motion limited to 2 uu (the game's limited
// axis on a cut; which axes it locks depends on the thrust flag, which the report does not carry), and the blade's
// collision with that Willie turned off through the game's CollisionDisablerFunctionLibrary: against its SK_Skeleton
// "Rigid Bones", and against its Mesh bones near the struck one (Disable Nearest Collisions, read from the class default:
// no spawn site sets it). The game also ignores bones a sphere trace finds around the impact point; the report carries no
// impact point, so those are not. No break thresholds are set (the game's scale with the impact; untested here): the hold
// ends when the attacker frees the blade, after the 10 s expiry, when the physics joint breaks, or when anything in it
// dies. While held, the stand-in rig stops driving that weapon (HeldWeapons), so its servo does not drag my fighter.
//
// Severs follow Cyrex0/HalfSword-MP's vitals-driven sever design (the owner decides, stand-ins follow its vitals),
// Copyright (c) 2026 Cyrex0 and the HalfSword-MP contributors, MIT (see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md); the capture and replay
