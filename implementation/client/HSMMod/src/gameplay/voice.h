// Voice chat (0.7.0-pre5, devices and the meter 0.7.0-pre6): the microphone through Steam (ISteamUser voice: the
// Windows default device) or, for a device the player picked, through waveIn (16 kHz mono, sent as IMA ADPCM,
// voice/hsm_adpcm.h); playback through waveOut on its own thread. The decisions (level gate, who hears whom, gains)
// are in shared/voice/hsm_voice.h; the session feeds this class what it may send and how loud each speaker is.
// Game thread, except the audio thread inside.
