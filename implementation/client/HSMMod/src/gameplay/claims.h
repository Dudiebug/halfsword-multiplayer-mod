// Phase 3 combat through the game's own damage code (owner authority). Every strike lands natively on the machine
// that sees it happen, against the stand-in there; the game's "Deal Complex Damage" on the stand-in is caught by a
// script-VM pre-hook (ue/script_hook.h) and becomes a HitClaim in the struck bone's frame (combat/hsm_claim.h). The
// stand-in still shows the strike (cuts, paint: it is Invulnerable, so Get Damage does nothing). The victim's owner
// replays the claim through its own "Deal Complex Damage" on its own fighter, so armour, wounds, bleeding,
// dismemberment, knock-outs and death happen there exactly as in a solo fight. Everything else that would let a
// stand-in take or deal damage natively is blocked before its body runs, outputs zeroed. Game thread only.
//
// The claim fields, the bone-frame rule, the replay's reset of "Last Complex Damage Impulse" (the claim already passed
// that gate on the attacker's screen) and the per-bone limit follow
// Cyrex0/HalfSword-MP's HSMPCombat design, Copyright (c) 2026 Cyrex0 and the HalfSword-MP contributors, MIT (see
// THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md); the hooks themselves are ours (pre-hooks that block, where HSMP undid after the fact).
// "Last Damage Taken"/"Last Damaged Bone" are left to the victim's own 0.2 s "Reset Last Damage Taken", as in a solo
// fight. Ours as well: one blow's contacts coalesce into one claim on the attacker (combat::BlowCoalescer), and the
// victim replays arriving claims from a per-victim queue, at most kReplaysPerTick per victim per frame.
// Props (test 5: rocks did no damage): a prop's contact with a fighter is decided where the prop is streamed
// (combat::DecidePropContact). A stand-in struck by a prop streamed here is a claim struck by that prop (its attacker
// the fighter simulated here that held or touched it last, else this machine's player), replayed with the victim's own
// copy of the prop as the striker; my fighter struck by a copy driven from elsewhere is blocked, the streamer's claim
// brings that blow.
