// Update check: once per game start, one HTTPS GET of GitHub's releases list (api.github.com) on a worker thread, with
// a User-Agent of "HSMMod/<version>" and nothing else about the player. The result is logged, shown on the multiplayer
// page and once in the chat of the first fight level. Which release counts as newer is session/hsm_version.h; the
// request goes through net/http_client.h, so WinHTTP is loaded only now. update_check=0 under [net] turns it off.
//
// UPDATE NOW: when the newer release carries dwmapi.dll and dwmapi.dll.sha256 (session/hsm_update.h), the notice gets a
// button. A click downloads both on a worker thread, checks the SHA-256, the size and that the file is a 64-bit dwmapi
// proxy DLL, writes dwmapi.dll.new beside the running DLL, renames the running one to dwmapi.dll.old and the new one
// into place (any failure puts the old one back). The player restarts the game; the next start deletes the .old file.
